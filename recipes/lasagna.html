    <h1>Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.webp">
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p> This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chamber of Commerce. I've made a couple of changes suggested to me by people from the area, such as which meat and wine to use or if there should be milk added or not. </p>
    <p> One thing never in question, though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and spices. Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="ingredients">
        <li> 1 (3 ounce) package pancetta, minced </li>
        <li> ½ cup diced carrot </li>
        <li> ½ cup diced celery </li>
        <li> ½ cup diced yellow onion </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
        <li> 7 ounces ground beef </li>
        <li> 6 ounces ground pork </li>
        <li> ½ cup dry red wine </li>
        <li> 1 ½ cups plain tomato sauce </li>
        <li> 2 cups vegetable broth, or more as needed </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p> Saute pancetta in a large stockpot over medium-high heat until fat has rendered, 1 to 2 minutes. Add carrot, celery, onion, and oil. Cook and stir until vegetables have softened and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add beef and pork. Cook, stirring and mashing meat into small crumbles, until browned, 5 to 7 minutes more. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Stir wine into the stockpot and bring to a boil. Add tomato sauce and stir; pour in 1 cup broth. Reduce heat to low and partially cover the pot to allow steam to escape. Simmer sauce for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Pour 1 more cup of broth into the sauce. Continue simmering until thick, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Add more broth only if absolutely necessary; ragu should drop, not run, off a spoon. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p> Start preparing pasta after sauce has been cooking for 1 1/2 hours. Bring water and salt to a boil in a small saucepan. Add spinach and cover until it returns to a boil. Stir gently and cook until spinach is heated through. Remove from heat, leave covered, and let cool. </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
